We need to setup the jailbreak app/tweak development environment THEOS. It can be found on GitHub under rpetrich alongside instructions for setting up.

1. In order to test on a device easily export an environment variable with an SSH enabled device’s IP:
export THEOS_DEVICE_IP=127.0.0.1

2. Next, compile with ‘make package’ followed by ‘make install’. ‘make install’ will install the package on the device over SSH and restart the springboard.

Currently the tweak might request permissions several times since apps call the several different methods many times while setting up the camera. However, this is a proof of concept app so this was not implemented in an effort to keep code simple and avoid distracting features like saving the permissions state for individual applications.
