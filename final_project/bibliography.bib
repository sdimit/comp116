	Abstract = {Apple iOS is one of the most popular mobile operating systems. As its core
security technology, iOS provides application sandboxing but assigns a
generic sandboxing profile to every third-party application. However,
recent attacks and incidents with benign applications demonstrate that this
design decision is vulnerable to crucial privacy and security breaches,
allowing applications (either benign or malicious) to access contacts,
photos, and device IDs. Moreover, the dynamic character of iOS apps written
in Objective-C renders the currently proposed static analysis tools less
useful. 

In this paper, we aim to address the open problem of preventing (not only
detecting) privacy leaks and simultaneously strengthening security against
runtime attacks on iOS. Compared to similar research work on the open
Android, realizing such a system for the closed-source iOS is highly
involved.

We present the design and implementation of PSiOS, a tool that features a
novel policy enforcement framework for iOS. It provides fine-grained,
application-specific, and user/administrator defined sandboxing for each
third-party application without requiring access to the application source
code. Our reference implementation deploys control-flow integrity based on
the recently proposed MoCFI (Mobile CFI) framework that only protects
applications against runtime attacks. We evaluated several popular iOS
applications (e.g., Facebook, WhatsApp) to demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of PSiOS.},
