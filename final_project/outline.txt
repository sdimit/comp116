Introduction
	Problem: iOS jailbreaking has been stigmatized as a potential invitation for malware and security risks, while too much trust is placed in the walled garden model of software distribution through the App Store. How can we turn jailbreaking into an advantage?

To the Community 
	Jailbreaking allows for:
	* unrestricted security research on the iOS platform.
	* third party patches in response to security vulnerabilities.
	This paper:
	* helps raise awareness about the security benefits of jailbreaking
	* uncovers pitfalls that could make jailbreaking a security risk


Privacy issues:
	* UDID leaks [b]
	* Path address book fiasco
	* apps sharing too much for no reason other than identification, data collection, etc

Security issues on non jailbroken devices:
	* methods to subvert the signing process on non jailbroken devices -  a GBA emulator’s source code used to be available on github and could be compiled and installed without a developer account. ad hoc distribution using leaked udids
	* methods to inject obfuscated malicious code into an App Store app
	* other methods of delivering malware
Security issues of jailbreaking
	* malicious/untrusted repositories
	* ssh attacks with default root password
	* retaining a jailbreak means not updating to the latest iOS
Security benefits of jailbreaking
	* deliver patches (jailbreak.me fix for pdf vulnerability)
	* allow for security research, finding flaws and patching them
	* enhance privacy - camera access still unrestricted, ad location tracking [a]
	* prevent *other* users from jailbreaking with a malicious intent (bypass passcode lock for example) [c]
